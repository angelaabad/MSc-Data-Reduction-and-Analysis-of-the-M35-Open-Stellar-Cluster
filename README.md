## Abstract
Observational astronomy allows, through the use of telescopes, astronomical devices and digital programs, the exploration of celestial bodies and the examination of their characteristics and peculiarities. The primary objective along this project is to develop computational codes within the Python program, as well as the implementation of the SAOImageDS9 tool, aimed at analyzing the data pertaining to the open stellar cluster M35.
From an observation taking place on February the 22nd of 2024 with the Telescope 21 of the Utah Desert Remote Observatory, an estimation of the cluster’s age has been calculated, obtaining $log(t_{age}) \approx [7.699, 8.477]$ by analyzing the position of the turn-off point and the distribution of some of its stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. To do so, photometric techniques were applied using B and V filters, characterizing apparent and absolute magnitudes (m and M) as well as stellar intrinsic colors ((B − V$)_{int}$) and effective temperatures (T$_{eff}$).
As a result, it has been concluded that the cluster is a relatively young source with most of its stars remaining along the main sequence according to the analyzed data.
